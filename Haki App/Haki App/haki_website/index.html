		  HAKI enlightens people on their rights, allows them to report crimes and injustices and offer various assistance.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Mission</strong><br />
Sensitize citizen that justice is a right for all but not a privilege for a few.

<br /><br />
Some of the grave injustices directed towards citizens and ignored include:<br />
Violence against women which has profound implications for health but is often <br />
ignored. Reports on Violence and Health notes that "one of the most common forms<br />
 of violence against women is that performed by a husband or  male partner.” <br />
 This type of violence is frequently invisible since it happens behind closed doors,<br />
  and effectively, when legal systems and cultural norms do not treat as a crime,<br />
   but rather as a "private" family matter, or a normal part of life.<br /> 
Other gender based injustices that goes unnoticed include:
   <ol>
	<li>Female genital mutilation(FGM)</li>
	<li>Forced early marriages</li>
	<li>Husband battering</li>
	<li>Rape cases especially by relatives</li>
   </ol>
   <br />	
Sexual harassment especially directed towards ladies leads to spread of HIV/AIDs, <br />
high rate of school drop outs and other psycho-social effects.<br />
Haki is an initiative designed to increase information about, awareness of, <br />
and capacity to address sexual violence around Kenya, and particularly among <br />
the vulnerable like in slums.
